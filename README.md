This is a partial fork of Et Futurum by ganymedes01. I will be working on backporting newer features of Minecraft version 1.8 and higher to Minecraft version 1.7.10.

Even though people are not using 1.7.10 as much now, with the success of 1.10.2, 1.11.2, and 1.12, I still think supporting older versions is important, especially since 1.7.10, even with the lack of possibilities granted with newer versions of Minecraft, has more mods available (at the time of writing this readme.md) for it.
